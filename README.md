# ETL Pipeline Using Databricks, AWS S3 & Snowflake

This repository contains code and instructions for building an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline for analyzing Olympic datasets. The pipeline leverages Databricks for data processing and transformation, AWS S3 for data storage, and Snowflake for data analysis. By following the steps outlined in this repository, you can gain valuable insights into athlete performance, historical trends, and more.

## Steps for Building the ETL Pipeline

### Step 1: Storing the Olympic Dataset in AWS S3

In this step, you will learn how to store the Olympic dataset in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), a scalable and reliable storage solution provided by AWS. The dataset files should be uploaded to an S3 bucket, organized in a suitable folder structure.

### Step 2: Extracting and Transforming the Data in Databricks

Databricks provides a powerful and collaborative environment for big data processing and analytics. In this step, you will learn how to create a Databricks cluster and connect it to your S3 bucket containing the Olympic dataset. Databricks supports various programming languages such as Python, Scala, and R, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your needs. You will also learn how to extract and transform the data using Databricks' built-in tools and libraries.

### Step 3: Dumping Processed Data into Snowflake

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform known for its scalability, performance, and ease of use. In this step, you will establish a connection between Databricks and Snowflake to load the processed Olympic dataset into Snowflake. You will learn how to create a Snowflake table that matches the transformed dataset's schema and use SQL commands or Snowflake's data loading utilities to efficiently load the data.

### Step 4: Analyzing the Olympic Dataset in Snowflake

With the Olympic dataset successfully loaded into Snowflake, you can now leverage Snowflake's SQL capabilities to perform complex analytical queries, generate insights, and visualize the data. Snowflake's architecture allows for parallel processing, enabling high-performance analytics even on large datasets. You will learn how to use Snowflake's SQL functions, windowing functions, and analytic capabilities to conduct various analyses on the Olympic dataset. Additionally, you will discover how to integrate Snowflake with popular business intelligence (BI) tools and data visualization platforms.
